## Hack Captive portals script

This script is using MAC-spoofing technique. This method is the only one which is present in all wireless and some wired  
Captive portals by design. Once a host is authorized by the Captive portal, its MAC and IP address are allowed  
unrestricted access.  
All one needs to do is sniff traffic on the network, find a host that is authorized, and spoof its IP and MAC address.  
Spoofing a MAC is dependent on your network card and driver but most modern network devices today support it.  
The downside of course is you have to observe someone already authenticated, but in places such as a crowded airport  
lobby this may be less difficult than it seems.
